This is a demo app for showcasing some of the latest (as of when written) Android features.

Features included:
* Written completely in Kotlin
* MVVM architecture using Viewmodels, Viewmodel Factories and Live Data
* AndroidX Navigation framework
* Dependency Injection (Dagger)
* Minimal Instrumental Unit Testing (minimal due to time constraints).

Some features that were not added due to time constraints, but can be in the future.
* proper documentation (Javadocs)
* proper UI navigation.i.e. navigation drawer, menu items, etc.
* proper login/authentication flow.
* additional code analysis (detekt can be used for this)
